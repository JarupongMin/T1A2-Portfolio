## Overview

This is a portfolio website to display some services of the company "Something something". This is currently under development. We will keep on adding those features in readme that we add on the website.

I was stumbled on some challenges while I was coding. For example adding the home page hyperlink and getting the link to work took me hours to figure out. I was able to overcome this challenge by researching and understanding the error saying "Cannot GET /pages/index.html" 

Secondly, I researched a way into adding an animation on the photo home page with the commands for scss to add a fade in effect using: 

I've played around using the opacity and animation. I've increased and decreased he amount of seconds on the animation to find balance and smoothness when the webpage opens up.

I've had to play around and learn the height px in order to fit the image into mobile first solution. 

At this stage I am still having a hard time with the layering of the photos because It would look great in mobile view and really strange on the desktop view. -09o9≈çop
